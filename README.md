# 2DLS -  2D liquid-solid classifier

## Microscopic view of Liquid/Solid

From microscopic view point, the particles in solids (crystals) are closely packed (form lattice structure) together. In liquids, the particles are less densely packed, giving them the ability to move around and slide past each other. Can we indentify a snapshot of a liquid/solid from the coordinates of particles by a machine learning model? 

## Dataset
The dataset includes (x, y) coordinates data obtained from molecular simulation. The training set are 10500 samples of hard discs model. In test set, 3600 samples of hard discs model and 6800 sets of of LJ potential model.
